# Guidio Frontend

## Summary
- Guidio is web application that allows creators to write written tutorials using markdown editor. It will first be dedicated to writing web development related guides, but it will slowly expand to other topics. 
- I teamed up of 2 colleagues for this side project and our team consists of Frontend Developer, Backend Developer and UI/UX Designer. 
- This is `Guidio`'s Frontend repository
- `Guidio`'s Backend repository: [Guidio Backend](https://github.com/ogi1998/Guidio-Backend)
- UX Figma Mockup:  [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/T4ft6JPxjhn3blDzZPknfX/Ogg?node-id=0%3A1&t=JryVqULrQlnGfZyo-1)

## How I came up with this idea
- When I started my web development learning journey I spent hours and hours watching video tutorials. As I expanded my knowledge I started getting tired of video tutorials and turned towards reading ebooks and online articles. I found many people making newsletters and writing articles on blog websites. However, I couldn't find a single application whose purpose is to strictly write guides/tutorials, therefore I decided to create one.

## Technologies used & Installation
- Technologies used are:
  - `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript` with `React.js` library
  - `Redux.js` for state management inside `React.js`
  - `Tailwind.js` for utility `CSS` classes
